# Tensorflow-Keras-LSTM-RNN-Automation-Project-for-Time-Series 

The Long Short-Term Memory network or LSTM is a recurrent neural network that can learn and forecast long sequences.

In this repository, I designed an LSTM RNNN model to predict time series (S&P 500 Stock Market) by utilizing Tensorlow & Keras Libraries.

On top of LSTM model's creation, I designed a for loop to facilitate an automation process.
